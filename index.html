<br>
 Is just a variation of the basic rules, no additional pieces or expansions are required.
 <br>
It is inspired in the Wild West movies where a new gunfighter in town could challenge the Sheriff and, if succeed, claim the Sheriff title for himself.
<br>
The idea is that you can challenge the ownership of a Road or Settlement by placing one of your own besides an existent one.
<br><br>
<b>Challenging (and winning) a Road:</b>
<br>
Once a road is challenged, the first involved in the dispute to outnumber the number of road pieces of the opponent in that position, keeps the road.
<br>

<br>
A road can be challenged and conquered in the same turn (but not necessarily).
<br>
While a road is being challenged, not further developments associated to that road can be made, meaning any of the contestants can develop another road or Settlement from it until the dispute is resolved.
<br>
A player can reinforce a road by placing a second (or more) roads in the same position to make it harder (but not impossible) for other opponents to attack.

<br>
<br>
<b>Challenging (and winning) a Settlement:</b>
<br>
A settlement can be challenged by placing another settlement in the same position.
Then the player that builds a City in that position first, wins the position.
<br>

<br>
When a settlement is being challenged, the production related to it goes to a Trust Fund, on the side of the board, and can be used for any of the players involved on the dispute in their respective turns, but can not be used to trade. When the dispute is resolved, the winner takes the remaining cards of the Trust Fund.
<br>
 When a 7 is rolled, if the Trust Fund is over 7 cards, it gets reduced in half.
 If the Robber is placed besides a disputed Settlement, any of the contestants can be robbed.
<br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<br>
The intention is to make the game more dynamic, since now you can attack other player's positions and also plan your defense to make your positions stronger against possible attacks.
