<b style="width:100%; text-align:center">Catan Wild West</b>
<br>
Is just a variation of the basic rules, no additional pieces or expansions are required.
 <br>
It is inspired by the Wild West movies where a new gunfighter in town could challenge the Sheriff and, if successful, claim the Sheriff title for himself.
 <br>
The idea is that you can challenge the ownership of a Road or Settlement by placing one of your own besides an existing one.

<br><br>
<b>Challenging (and winning) a Road:</b>
<br>
Once a road is challenged, the first involved in the dispute to outnumber the number of road pieces of the opponent in that position, keeps the road.
<br>

<br>
A road can be challenged and conquered in the same turn (but not necessarily).
<br>
While a road is being challenged, no further developments associated with that road can be made, meaning any of the contestants can develop another road or Settlement from it until the dispute is resolved.
<br>
A player can reinforce a road by placing a second (or more) road in the same position to make it harder (but not impossible) for other opponents to attack. 
<br>

<br>
<p style="font-size:11px">In the picture above. Blue player would need two roads to challenge Red's road, and three to win it.</p>
<br><br>
<b>Challenging (and winning) a Settlement:</b>
<br>
A settlement can be challenged by placing another settlement in the same position. Then the dispute is won by the player who builds a City in that position first.


<br>

<br>
When a settlement is being challenged, the production related to it are placed in the side of the board, in a "Trust Fund", and can be used for any of the players involved in the dispute in their respective turns to build or buy Development Cards, taking cards from the Trust Fund to your personal deck is not allowed unless you win the dispute. 
<br>
 When a 7 is rolled, if the Trust Fund is over 7 cards, it gets reduced in half.
<br>
 If the Robber is placed besides a disputed Settlement, any of the contestants can be robbed.
<br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<br>
The intention is to make the game more dynamic by giving attacking and defense capabilities to the settlers.
